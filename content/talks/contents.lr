## APIs are for People Too! ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/lisadusseault/apis-are-for-people-too)) <br> <small>Lisa Dusseault</small>

How do you integrate an external Web API into your product so that it
benefits the user and the company? How can engineering and product
managers work together to build and maintain it? Come learn about the
seven key success factors to understand when integrating a Web API!


## Don't Panic: Navigating SEP fields for Software Teams ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1stJ6qU7aPRkKYAOvEMeSO0vMi6EVnsFu/view)) <br> <small>Hayley Denbraver</small>

A SEP field is also known as a “Somebody else’s problem field”, an idea
described in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series. The idea is
that humans will ignore things when they are convinced that it isn
t their problem. This talk goes into the intersections of software and
SEPs.


## Fantastic Blocks and Where To Hide Them ([previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBavPw0Kc0w)) <br> <small>Christopher Neugebauer</small>

Ruby has blocks. JavaScript has blocks. Swift has blocks. Python
doesn’t have blocks.

In this talk, we’ll look at why Python doesn’t have blocks, and recent
programming techniques that have developed in languages that do have
blocks. Then we’ll look at what we – or Python – can do about it!

## Keeping fun in computing ([previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo4EJq1slD8)) <br> <small>Dustin Ingram</small>

In this talk, we’ll explore how maintaining a sense of fun and whimsy
in science has a profound effect on discovery, innovation and progress.

We’ll discuss how to keep computing fun, maintain our natural
curiosity, and be open to the unknown, to the benefit of our field,
coworkers, and ourselves.

## PhD not required: a layperson's guide to reading journal articles <br> <small>Julia Duimovich</small>

Learning from journal articles is often a chore, thanks to their
esoteric language and hyper-specific topics. But they are still great
educational sources & avoiding them can limit your growth. You’ll leave
this talk wanting to find yourself an article, drink, and quiet space
to go learn new things!


## Protected Python: It's time we had 'the talk' ([slides](https://github.com/mertzjames/Presentations/tree/master/2019_02_PyBeach)) <br> <small>James Mertz</small>

Today, developers and users of Python are being attacked on a daily
basis, most of the time, without their knowledge. We need to be more
aware of these attacks and weaknesses to make more educated design
decisions for our Python code.


## Reinventing the Wheel (and Adding Spikes to It)! <br> <small>Jay Miller</small>

We are often told that reinventing the wheel is never a good thing. I
tend to think that I have learned so much by building things that
already existed in some way shape or form.

This talk breaks down my static site generator, aka wheel that I built,
and some of the valuable lessons learned.


## Useful Cryptography <br> <small>Randall Degges</small>

Cryptography is often thought of as a scary topic, but it doesn't have
to be. In this talk, you'll learn about different types of useful
cryptography, how they work (without needing a PhD in mathematics), and
how to immediately start applying these concepts in your projects.
